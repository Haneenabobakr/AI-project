<h2><li>Google Maps and Ride-Hailing Applications</li></h2>

<p>One doesn’t have to put much thought into traveling to a new destination anymore. Instead of having to rely on confusing address directions, you can now simply open up the handy map application on your phone and type in your destination.

So how does the application know the exact directions, the optimal route, and even road barriers and traffic congestions? Not too long ago, only GPS (satellite-based navigation) was used as guidance for commuting. But now, artificial intelligence is being incorporated to give users a much more enhanced experience in regards to their specific surroundings. 

Via machine learning, the app algorithm remembers the edges of the buildings that have been fed into the system after the staff has manually identified them. This allows the addition of clear visuals of buildings on the map. Another feature is the quality of recognizing and understanding handwritten house numbers which help commuters reach the exact house they were looking for. Places that lack formal street signs can also be identified with their outlines or handwritten labels.

The application has been taught to understand and identify traffic. Thus, it recommends the best route that avoids roadblocks and congestion. The AI-based algorithm also tells users the exact distance and time they will reach their destination as it has been taught to calculate this based on traffic conditions. Users can also view the pictures of their locations before getting there. 

So by employing a similar AI technology, various ride-hailing applications have also come into existence. So whenever you book a cab from an app by putting your location on a map, this is how it works. </p>

<h2><li>Face Detection and Recognition</li></h2>


<p>Using virtual filters on our face when taking pictures and using face ID for unlocking our phones are two applications of AI that are now part of our daily lives. The former incorporates face detection meaning any human face is identified. The latter uses face recognition through which a specific face is recognised.

How does this work?

Intelligent machines often match – and sometimes go even above and beyond! – human capabilities. Human babies start recognizing facial features like eyes, nose, lips and face shapes. But that is not all there is to a face. There are a plethora of factors that make human faces unique. Smart machines are taught to identify facial coordinates (x, y, w, and h; that make a square around the face as an area of interest), landmarks (eyes, nose etc), and alignment (geometric structures). This takes the human ability to recognize faces several notches up.

Face recognition is also used for surveillance and security by government facilities or at airports. For example, Gatwick Airport, London, uses face recognition cameras as ID checks before allowing passengers to board the plane.</p>
<h2><li>Text Editors or Autocorrect</li></h2>

<p>When you’re typing out documents, there are inbuilt or downloadable auto-correcting tools for editors that check for spelling mistakes, grammar, readability, and plagiarism depending on their complexity level. 

It must have taken you a while to learn your language before you became fluent in it. Similarly, artificially intelligent algorithms also use machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to identify incorrect usage of language and suggest corrections.

Linguists and computer scientists work together to teach machines grammar, just like you were taught at school. Machines are fed with copious amounts of high-quality language data, organized in such a manner that machines can understand it. So when you use even a single comma incorrectly, the editor will mark it red and prompt suggestions.

The next time you have a language editor check your document, know that you are using one of the many examples of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2><li>Search and Recommendation Algorithms</li></h2>

<p>When you want to watch your favorite movies or listen to songs or perhaps shop online, have you noticed that the items suggested to you are perfectly aligned with your interests? This is the beauty of AI.

These smart recommendation systems learn your behavior and interests from your online activities and offer you similar content. The personalized experience is made possible by continuous training. The data is collected at the frontend (from the user), stored as big data and analyzed through machine learning and deep learning. It is then able to predict your preferences by recommendations that keep you entertained without having to search any further.

Similarly, the optimized search engine experience is another example of artificial intelligence.  Usually, our top search results have the answer we’re looking for. How does that happen?

Quality controlling algorithms are fed with data to recognize high-quality content over SEO-spammed, poor content. This helps make an ascending order of search results based on quality for the best user experience. 

As search engines are made up of codes, natural language processing technology helps these applications to understand humans. In fact, they are also able to predict what a human wants to ask by compiling top-ranked searches and predicting their queries when they start to type.

New features such as voice search and image search are also constantly being programmed into machines. If you want to find a song that is playing at a mall, you can simply hold your phone up to it, and a music-identifying app will tell you what it is within seconds. After sifting through the rich database of songs, the machine will also tell you all the details related to that song. </p>

<h2><li>Chatbots</li></h2>

<p>As a customer, getting queries answered can be time-consuming. An artificially intelligent solution to this is the use of algorithms to train machines to cater to customers via chatbots. This enables machines to answer FAQs, and take and track orders.

Chatbots are taught to impersonate the conversational styles of customer representatives through natural language processing (NLP). Advanced chatbots no longer require specific formats of inputs (e.g. yes/no questions). They can answer complex questions requiring detailed responses. They will give the impression of a customer representative when, in fact, they are just another example of artificial intelligence.</p>
