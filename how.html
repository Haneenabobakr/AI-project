  <h2><li>Machine Learning</li></h2>
  <p>Machine Learning (ML) means self-learning. It adapts to its environment and performs a task without getting assistance from humans; in clear terms, it’s not explicitly instructed to undertake a function in a particular type of situation; it just has to learn from its experiences automatically. Nevertheless, you will have to feed the machine a massive amount of data to utilize the data for working orderly and wisely. Still, you wouldn’t have to give it instructions to perform every single task. For instance, personal smart assistants such as Siri, Google assistant, and social media are driven by machine learning.</p>
  <h2><li>Deep Learning</li></h2>
  <p>
  Deep Learning (DL), or deep neural network, is a sub-field of machine learning, which means that it is associated with artificial intelligence. This involves the cognitive ability of the machine — replicating a human brain. It basically means training machines to recognize data and data patterns and to predict analytics. The AI would learn to classify tasks and data through various images, sounds, and texts — observation is an essential element here. Some examples of deep learning are face recognition, automated translations, and fraud detection.</p>
  <h2><li>Narrow Artificial Intelligence</li></h2>
  <p>Narrow AI is almost everywhere nowadays; you can find it in computers, cars, phones, etc. It specializes in performing a single, specific task; however, it does have some limitations that won’t allow it to work flexibly. Let’s take a look at Alexa: it is a voice assistant that can perform a wide variety of tasks in response to our commands, but only with certain constraints, because it wouldn’t have an answer nor an output each time you interact with it in context of more of a humanly way; or else, even if it would reply, its answer might not meet your expectations.</p>
<h2><li>General Artificial Intelligence</li></h2>
<p>
  General AI is an absolute human but without human anatomy. In other words, it’s a super complex machine and doesn’t necessarily have restrictions while executing a task — it shows human intelligence in its performance. For your better understanding, these are types of robots you have very often seen in movies and, of course, in your imagination where you would have the robots cook some delicious food, do all the household chores and your official work; however, these kinds of things haven’t taken place yet, but for sure a happening of narrow AI to general AI is in process. Advancement in AI will be all over the place in the future.</p>
